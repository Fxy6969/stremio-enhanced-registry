- Follow the existing JSON structure.
- For plugins, the "download" field in the metadata must link to a direct raw file URL pointing to a specific version of your plugin (not a latest or dynamic link).

**For security reasons, you will have to submit a new PR every update to update your plugin metadata, so I can review your code and make sure it's safe for users.**

**For themes, one submission is enough. Just make sure your "download" field links to always the latest version available.**
